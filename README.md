# DSA

My attempt at working through LeetCode problems to get better at problem solving

## Udemy

My notes are from this course, I highly encourage you to purchase this course if you are interested in learning more about DSA. I am not affiliated with Udemy or Colt Steele in any way, I just really enjoyed this course and wanted to share my notes and learnings. This is in no way a replacement for the course, again, you should still purchase it and go through it yourself.
