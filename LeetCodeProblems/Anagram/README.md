# Thought Process

Attempted to create a hash map and set each letter of the string to do a comparison to the second string, was not working as intended, kept failing.

Opted to try creating objects and setting the keys as the letters of the strings, then doing a comparison between the strings. This worked, but was not the most efficient way to do it.
